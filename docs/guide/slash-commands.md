# Slash commands

[Claude slash commands](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/slash-commands) are markdown files in `~/.claude/commands/` that define reusable workflows. When you type `/command-name` in Claude, it expands to the full prompt.

Slash commands are more powerful than simple prompts because they can encode detailed, multi-step instructions that the agent follows intelligently.

## Using with workmux

Slash commands pair well with workmux workflows:

- **`/merge`** - Commit, rebase, and merge the current branch
- **`/rebase`** - Rebase with flexible target and smart conflict resolution
- **`/commit`** - Commit staged changes with your preferred style

You can trigger these from the [dashboard](/guide/dashboard/configuration) using the `c` and `m` keybindings:

```yaml
dashboard:
  commit: "/commit"
  merge: "/merge"
```

## Example: /merge command

This is the `/merge` command the author uses. It handles the complete merge workflow:

1. Commit staged changes using a specific commit style
2. Rebase onto the base branch with smart conflict resolution
3. Run `workmux merge` to merge, clean up, and send a notification when complete

Save this as `~/.claude/commands/merge.md`:

````markdown
Commit, rebase, and merge the current branch.

This command finishes work on the current branch by:

1. Committing any staged changes
2. Rebasing onto the base branch
3. Running `workmux merge` to merge and clean up

## Step 1: Commit

If there are staged changes, commit them. Use lowercase, imperative mood, no conventional commit prefixes. Skip if nothing is staged.

## Step 2: Rebase

Get the base branch from git config:

```
git config --local --get "branch.$(git branch --show-current).workmux-base"
```

If no base branch is configured, default to "main".

Rebase onto the local base branch (do NOT fetch from origin first):

```
git rebase <base-branch>
```

IMPORTANT: Do NOT run `git fetch`. Do NOT rebase onto `origin/<branch>`. Only rebase onto the local branch name (e.g., `git rebase main`, not `git rebase origin/main`).

If conflicts occur:

- BEFORE resolving any conflict, understand what changes were made to each
  conflicting file in the base branch
- For each conflicting file, run `git log -p -n 3 <base-branch> -- <file>` to
  see recent changes to that file in the base branch
- The goal is to preserve BOTH the changes from the base branch AND our branch's
  changes
- After resolving each conflict, stage the file and continue with
  `git rebase --continue`
- If a conflict is too complex or unclear, ask for guidance before proceeding

## Step 3: Merge

Run: `workmux merge --rebase --notification`

This will merge the branch into the base branch and clean up the worktree and
tmux window.

### Why this works well

Instead of just running `workmux merge`, this command:

- Commits staged changes first
- Reviews base branch changes before resolving conflicts
- Follows your commit style
- Asks for guidance on complex conflicts

## Example: /rebase command

A rebase command that resolves conflicts by first understanding changes in the target branch. Save as `~/.claude/commands/rebase.md`:

```markdown
Rebase the current branch.

Arguments: $ARGUMENTS

Behavior:

- No arguments: rebase on local main
- "origin": fetch origin, rebase on origin/main
- "origin/branch": fetch origin, rebase on origin/branch
- "branch": rebase on local branch

Steps:

1. Parse arguments:
   - No args → target is "main", no fetch
   - Contains "/" (e.g., "origin/develop") → split into remote and branch, fetch
     remote, target is remote/branch
   - Just "origin" → fetch origin, target is "origin/main"
   - Anything else → target is that branch name, no fetch
2. If fetching, run: `git fetch <remote>`
3. Run: `git rebase <target>`
4. If conflicts occur, handle them carefully (see below)
5. Continue until rebase is complete

Handling conflicts:

- BEFORE resolving any conflict, understand what changes were made to each
  conflicting file in the target branch
- For each conflicting file, run `git log -p -n 3 <target> -- <file>` to see
  recent changes to that file in the target branch
- The goal is to preserve BOTH the changes from the target branch AND our
  branch's changes
- After resolving each conflict, stage the file and continue with
  `git rebase --continue`
- If a conflict is too complex or unclear, ask for guidance before proceeding
```

Usage: `/rebase`, `/rebase origin`, `/rebase origin/develop`, `/rebase feature-branch`

See [Resolve merge conflicts with Claude Code](https://raine.dev/blog/resolve-conflicts-with-claude/) for more on this approach.

## Example: /commit command

A commit command that follows a consistent style. Save as `~/.claude/commands/commit.md`:

```markdown
Commit the changes using this style:

- lowercase
- imperative mood
- concise, no conventional commit prefixes
- optionally use a context prefix when it adds clarity (e.g., "docs:", "cli:")

If nothing is staged, stage all changes first.
```

## Task delegation

For spawning parallel agents in worktrees, see [Delegating tasks](/guide/delegating-tasks) which covers the `/worktree` slash command.
